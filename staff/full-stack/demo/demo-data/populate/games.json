Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>"},{"id":5193,"name":"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee","platform":27,"description":"<p>Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee is the first chapter of the Oddworld franchise.

He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him.

Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>"},{"id":5159,"name":"Resident Evil 2 (1998)","platform":105,"description":"<p>If the suspense doesn&#39;t kill you, something else will!

It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.</p>\n<p>In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as &quot;Doomguy&quot;, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as &quot;WADs&quot;. As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre&#39;s boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game&#39;s release, became known simply as &quot;Doom clones&quot;. Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.</p>\n<p>The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game&#39;s source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.</p>"},{"id":25080,"name":"Super Mario Bros.","platform":79,"description":"<p>Mario and Luigi star in their first ever Mushroom Kingdom adventure!

It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn&#39;s work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.<br />\nPong quickly became a success and was the first commercially successful video game, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong&#39;s gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original&#39;s gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. due to its cultural impact. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.</p>"},{"id":52391,"name":"Adventure","platform":22,"description":"<p>Adventure is a video game for the Atari 2600 video game console, released in late 1979–1980. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice and return it to the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.</p>\n<p>Adventure was conceived as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.</p>\n<p>Adventure received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games.

Initially released for arcade platform, the game shares gameplay mechanics with its predecessors, where the player takes control of a squad of four soldiers and faces continuous waves of enemies throughout each level.<br />\nThe game’s plot follows the previous events, where the main characters succeeded in overthrowing a maniac and bringing relative peace. This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes&#39; nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character’s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.<br />\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character’s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.</p>"},{"id":14948,"name":"METAL SLUG","platform":12,"description":"<p>Metal Slug, is a run and gun video game developed and originally released by Nazca Corporation and later published by SNK.
